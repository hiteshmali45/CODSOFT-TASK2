                <h3> Farm-Help Management</h3>
                <p> In this Project Presentation, "Farm-Help Management " provides the farmers to upload 
                    their products and helps its users or buyers to get the details of the agricultural products. The main 
                    objective of this project is building an application which will help the farmers to sell their products by 
                    uploading the details of that product in the application. Farm-Help Management is an online web 
                    application where buyers can go through the list of products uploaded by the farmer and can add to 
                    their cart or buy the required product directly. Both farmers and buyers need to login separately using 
                    their own user id and password. And the buyer can place their items into a cart and can purchase it. This 
                    application is developed using Python programming language.</p>
